You can start the instance and open the web page.

Solution:
Home page:

Upon opening the web page for the first time, we will redirected to the web's home page. From the challenge's description, we know that we need to use web inspector. This also could be a hint that the flag are located in the source code.
The other hint said that the code may or not be encoded. So this help us to try to find something encoded string.

Next to we need to do is examine each page's source code. There are 3 pages in this web, home, about, and contact. I didn't find anything interesting in home page and contact page.
But, when i open the about.html and read the source code using web inspector in sources, i found something interesting.

An encoded string was found here. So next step because i know this is base64 encoded string, i only need to use base64 decoder online tool then submit the flag in picoCTF and that's it. 
But, if you don't know what encoded string is that, and want to use a tool in the future to identify the cipher text you find, you can use online tool to what kind of cipher text is that.
Personally, i like to use this tool https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier.

Thank you for reading my write up! Have a great day!.
