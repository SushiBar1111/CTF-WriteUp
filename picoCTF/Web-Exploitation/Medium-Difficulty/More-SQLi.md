Solution:
If we start the instance, it will provide us the web.
Here are the login page:

From the challenge's name, we know that this challenge involved in SQL Injection. First, i tried basic SQLi payload, which is **' OR 1=1#** on the username and the password is gibberish random characters.

After clicking the login button, the page turned and giving this output:

It is shown that the web is vulnerable to SQL injection, but not with my previous payload. So i tried another payload, **' OR 1=1 --** and this didn't work. So i tried to input the SQLi payload in the password and the random characters in the username.
The payload that i used was : ' OR 1=1; and it worked. This will return as a true and bypass the login authentication.

After logged in, i was redirected to welcome page:

It has a data that possibility they from the database. So i input SQL query to list all the tables in the search box. This is the first query that i tried **SELECT name, sql, null from sqlite_master;--**. But it didn't work.
So, i tried to add something on the beginning of the query. I used **test' UNION SELECT name, sql, null from sqlite_master;--**. It worked!. Here is the output:

From the output (the image above), i knew that the flag was in more_table table. So next is try to access that flag. Using previous SQL query but with a little bit of modification **test' UNION SELECT flag, null, null, from more_table**.
I got the flag.
